Measurement 5 contains biased measurements. Unbuffered uart causes large latency. Latency is between reports--> UART latency is added.

Measurement 6 may be biased, not sure. latency is between each gyro interrupt, latency is not averaged, actual deltaT.

Measurement 7, unbiased, latency is averaged.

Measurement 8, encoder position is filtered with 3rd order moving average filter.

Measurement 9, encoder position is filtered with 4th order moving average filter.
